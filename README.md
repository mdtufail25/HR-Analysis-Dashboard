# HR-Analysis-Dashboard
HR Analytics Dashboard | Power BI Project
Excited to share my recent work on an interactive HR Analytics dashboard built in Power BI.
This report provides insights into key HR metrics like:

Total Employees & Attrition Rate

Attrition analysis by Age Group, Gender, Education, Department, and Salary Hike

Distribution of employees by Job Role, Marital Status, and Education Field


This project helped me better understand workforce trends and how data can be used to support HR decision-making.
Always learning, improving, and growing!
